You're all set!

1.  Press **F5** or click the green "play" button (with `HMS.Web` selected) at the top of Visual Studio to build and run your project.
2.  Your web browser will open to the home page.
3.  Click the **"Patients"** link in the navigation bar.

You should now see the **Patient Index** page. It will be empty.



**Test the functionality:**

*   Click **"Create New"**. Fill out the form and click **Create**. You will be redirected back to the list, which now shows your new patient.
*   Click **"Edit"** on the patient record to change some details.
*   Click **"Details"** to see a read-only view.
*   Click **"Delete"** to remove the patient record.

### Next Steps to Expand Your HMS

You have successfully built the core patient management module! This is the foundation upon which you can build a complete HMS. Here's how you can expand it:

1.  **Add Related Models:**
    *   Create an `Appointment` model with a `ForeignKey` to `PatientId`.
    *   Create a `MedicalRecord` model, also linked to a `Patient`.
    *   Create `Doctor`, `Nurse`, etc. models for the HR side.
    *   Use scaffolding again to build controllers and views for these new models.

2.  **Implement Authentication and Authorization:**
    *   Re-create the project but select an **Authentication Type** like "Individual Accounts". This will use ASP.NET Core Identity to add user registration and login.
    *   Use the `[Authorize]` attribute on your controllers to protect pages from unauthorized access.

3.  **Build a Web API:**
    *   Create a new controller that inherits from `ControllerBase` instead of `Controller`.
    *   This API can serve data to a mobile application (e.g., for doctors on the go) or a modern JavaScript front-end (like React or Angular).

4.  **Improve the User Interface:**
    *   Explore Bootstrap components to make the UI more professional.
    *   Add client-side validation using JavaScript for a better user experience.
